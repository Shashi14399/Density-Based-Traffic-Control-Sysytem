# Density-Based-Traffic-Control-Sysytem
Density Based traffic control system using Aurdino (Microcontroller) is used to control the traffic based on
density. The road which has higher density will have green signal and rest of the roads have red signal. If the
density of the traffic is not much in any of the roads, then it acts like a normal traffic system.
Hardware used: Arduino, IR sensors and LEDs
Refer to report for detailed description of the project.
